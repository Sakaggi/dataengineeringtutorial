    "# Dummy Variables Exercise\n",

    "| 3          | Employment       |\n",
    "\n",
    "into new features that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Project ID | Energy | Transportation | Health | Employment |\n",
    "|------------|--------|----------------|--------|------------|\n",
    "| 0          | 1      | 0              | 0      | 0          |\n",
    "| 1          | 0      | 1              | 0      | 0          |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note if you were going to use this data with a model influenced by multicollinearity, you would want to eliminate one of the columns to avoid redundant information.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning behind these transformations is that machine learning algorithms read in numbers not text. Text needs to be converted into numbers. You could assign a number to each category like 1, 2, 3, and 4. But a categorical variable has no inherent order, so you want to reflect this in your features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas makes it very easy to create dummy variables with the [get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html) method. In this exercise, we'll create dummy variables from the World Bank projects data; however, there's a caveat. The World Bank data is not particularly clean, so we'll need to explore and wrangle the data first.\n",

    "What else can you do? If you look at all of the diferent sector1 categories, it might be useful to combine a few of them together. For example, there are various categories with the term \"Energy\" in them.

Some categories have the term \"Renewable Energy\", so perhaps you could make a separate \"Renewable Energy\" category.\n",
